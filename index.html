                    Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and other evil corporations out to
                    hoard
                    and sell your most personal data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of
                    knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy and freedom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple:<br>An autonomous peer-to-peer network

                    encryption.
